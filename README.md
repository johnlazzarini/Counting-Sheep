# Counting Sheep
## Summary
Google Play Store Application, where users try to answer as many math questions as they can before time runs out.

#### Warning:
My most recent attempt to upload from IntelliJ included a LOT of earlier drafts for this project -- the actual files that were published are much cleaner.  I'm working diligently to switch out the updated files -- see the AddIntegersActivity.java, for example, for the newest versions.

## Repository contents
Most of the interesting files -- those that contain the XML and Java requisite to the application's structure -- can be found by accessing the link below:
